# ImgToSummary

ImgToSummary is a Python project that extracts text from images, preprocesses the text, and summarizes the text using OpenAI's GPT model. The project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images, natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text, and a large language model (LLM) to summarize the text.

## Features

- Extracts text from images using the UnstructuredImageLoader class from the langchain_community library.
- Preprocesses the text using tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Summarizes the text using OpenAI's GPT model.

## Goal

The aim is to build open-source tools for image analysis and text summarization. This project will include:

1. Multiple OCR tools for text extraction.
2. Various large language models (LLMs) for image analysis.
3. A prompt analysis feature to customize the different tools.
4. Diverse image preprocessing techniques to enhance image-to-text extraction.

These tools will work together to provide a comprehensive solution for both image analysis and text summarization tasks.
